# PracTwist v2

PracTwist is a mod for Chameleon Twist to enhance Speedrun practice - developed by [**Rainchus**](https://github.com/Rainchus/) and [**Ellie**]((https://github.com/Elisiah/)).

The [previous version](https://github.com/Rainchus/ChameleonTwistJP-Mod) of PracTwist was patched using custom boot assembly written by Rainchus. 

Version 2 is being built such that it will attach to our [Decompilation project](https://github.com/chameleonTwistRet/chameleonTwistv1.0-JP). This should allow for more flexibility and better readability of the code.
